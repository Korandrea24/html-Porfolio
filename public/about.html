<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I would like to start with a brief introduction of my work experience, I have been working in the business of Customer Service for almost 5 years now, starting in the Front Desk of a luxury hotel in my hometown, having one-on-one interactions with guests from all over the world, I developed my communication skills and improved my English dramatically, offering an outstanding service to the guests and always going the extra mile to fulfill their requests.</p>
<p>Then and due to the pandemic, I started working in the Call Center industry, where I had the opportunity to learn a lot about the culture and how businesses are handled in the United States.</p>
<p>Throughout these years, I have gained a lot of experience in the formal email writing, creation of reports, invoices, agreements, etc.; I would say that I have taken the word “malleable” to the next level.</p>
<p>I consider myself a perfectionist in whatever is relied on me, since I worry about the details and how I can take a simple task to something that stands out; I am easy learning person eager for knowledge, in fact, one of my hobbies is to learn, nothing can bring more joy to my life than learning new topics. </p>
<p>Therefore, even I have zero experience in the logistic area, I am pretty sure, I will be the perfect fit for your company, learning everything you have to offer to your clients is a challenge that I am passionate and excited about.</p>
<p>Before leaving, I would like to quote Edward Morgan Forster: “One person with passion is better than forty people merely interested.”</p>
